# Physician Contract Analyzer — MVP Product Spec

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Product Overview

**One-liner:** Upload a physician employment contract PDF → AI extracts key terms → get a plain English report highlighting risks, red flags, and questions to ask before signing.

### The Problem

Physicians sign employment contracts worth $1–5M+ in lifetime value with little to no legal training. Attorney reviews cost $2,000–5,000 and take 1–2 weeks. Most doctors sign without a proper review — or worse, they skim it themselves and miss buried clauses that cost them six figures later (tail coverage, non-competes, termination traps).

### The Solution

A self-service tool that accepts a physician employment contract PDF, runs it through AI extraction and analysis, and returns a structured, scannable report in plain English. The report highlights what matters, what's risky, and what to push back on — in minutes, not weeks.

### Who It's For

- Physicians (residents, fellows, attendings) reviewing a new employment offer
- Physicians renegotiating or renewing an existing contract
- Physician recruiters or advisors who want to add contract analysis as a value-add

### What It Is NOT

- Legal advice (report includes a clear disclaimer)
- A replacement for an attorney on complex or high-stakes negotiations
- A contract negotiation tool — it analyzes, it doesn't negotiate

## 2. Output Format — The Report

The generated report is designed for a busy physician who is not a lawyer. It must be scannable in 5 minutes and deep-readable in 20.

### 2.2 Section Details

#### Disclaimer (top of every report)
> **This report is for informational purposes only and does not constitute legal advice.** It is generated by AI analysis and may contain errors or omissions. We strongly recommend having an attorney licensed in your state review your contract before signing. No attorney-client relationship is created by using this service.

#### Executive Summary
1–2 paragraphs, plain English. Covers:
- Type of contract (employment, independent contractor, partnership buy-in)
- Employer type (hospital system, private practice, academic, PE-backed)
- Overall tone assessment (physician-friendly, neutral, employer-heavy)
- The 2–3 most important things the physician should know
- Overall risk level

**Example:**
> This is a 3-year employment agreement with Midwest Health Partners, a private-equity-backed multispecialty group. The contract is **employer-heavy** with several terms that deviate significantly from market norms. Most critically: you would be responsible for tail coverage costs estimated at $30,000–$80,000 if you leave for any reason, the non-compete covers a 30-mile radius for 2 years which would effectively force you to relocate, and termination without cause requires only 60 days' notice from the employer with no cure period. We rate this contract **Yellow — Proceed with Caution** and recommend attorney review before signing.

#### Contract Scorecard

| Rating | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🟢 **Green — Low Risk** | Terms are largely physician-friendly or market-standard. Minor items to clarify. |
| 🟡 **Yellow — Proceed with Caution** | Multiple terms deviate from market norms or favor the employer. Attorney review recommended. |
| 🔴 **Red — Significant Risk** | Contains one or more terms that could cause serious financial or career harm. Do not sign without attorney review and negotiation. |

Displayed as a large visual badge at the top of the report with the rating and a one-sentence explanation.

#### Key Terms Table

#### Red Flag Alerts

Visually distinct warning boxes (red background, bold text). See Section 4 for samples.

#### Market Comparison

Brief comparison of key financial terms against specialty/geography benchmarks:

- **Data sources:** MGMA, AMGA, Doximity, SullivanCotter (cited but not reproduced)
- **Presented as:** Simple bar or bullet comparisons — "Your offer vs. market median"
- **Terms compared:** Base salary, total compensation, RVU thresholds, signing bonus, CME allowance, non-compete radius/duration, PTO days

**Example:**
> **Base Salary:** Your offer of $275,000 is at the **55th percentile** for cardiology in the Midwest metro market (MGMA 2025 median: $260,000).
>
> **Non-Compete Radius:** At 30 miles, this is in the **top 15% most restrictive** for cardiology contracts nationally. The median is 15 miles.
>
> **RVU Bonus Threshold:** At 5,500 wRVUs, you would need to exceed the **65th percentile** of cardiology production nationally to earn any bonus compensation.

#### Questions to Ask Before Signing

Numbered, actionable list of 5–10 questions tailored to the specific contract. Not generic — each references a term found in *this* contract.

**Example questions:**
1. "The contract assigns tail coverage costs to me upon any separation. Would the group consider covering tail if I complete the full 3-year term?"
2. "The non-compete covers 30 miles for 24 months across all cardiology subspecialties. Is there flexibility to narrow this to interventional cardiology only, or reduce the radius to 15 miles?"
3. "Termination without cause requires only 60 days' notice with no cure period. Can we add a 30-day cure period and extend notice to 90 days for both parties?"
4. "The assignment clause allows transfer of this contract without my consent. Can we add a provision that allows me to terminate without penalty if ownership changes?"
5. "The RVU bonus threshold of 5,500 wRVUs is above the national median. What percentage of current physicians in the group are hitting this threshold?"

## 4. Red Flag Alerts — Sample Output

These appear as prominent warning boxes in the report.

---

> ### 🚩 RED FLAG: Tail Coverage Trap — You Could Owe $30,000–$80,000 When You Leave
>
> **Section 8.3 — Malpractice Insurance**
>
> This contract uses **claims-made** malpractice insurance and assigns **100% of tail coverage costs to you** upon separation — regardless of whether you quit, are terminated without cause, or the employer simply chooses not to renew. Tail premiums for your specialty typically run **$30,000–$80,000** and are due as a lump sum. This is money you'll owe even if the employer fires you with 60 days' notice. Many physicians don't discover this cost until it's too late. **In market-standard contracts, the employer covers tail if the physician completes the initial term or is terminated without cause.** This clause effectively functions as a golden handcuff — leaving at any point triggers a five-figure bill. **Ask the employer to cover tail upon completion of the initial term or upon without-cause termination, at minimum.**

---

> ### 🚩 RED FLAG: Non-Compete Would Force Relocation — 30 Miles, 24 Months, All Subspecialties
>
> **Section 12.1 — Restrictive Covenants**
>
> The non-compete clause restricts you from practicing **any form of cardiology** within a **30-mile radius** of **any employer location** for **24 months** after separation. The employer operates 14 locations across the metro area. When mapped, this non-compete effectively **blankets the entire metropolitan region and surrounding suburbs**. If enforced, you would need to either relocate your family or stop practicing your specialty for two years. The national median non-compete for cardiologists is 15 miles and 12 months. This clause is **2x the typical radius and duration** and applies even if *the employer* terminates you without cause. **This is one of the most consequential clauses in the contract. Request a reduction to 15 miles / 12 months, limit it to your specific subspecialty, and add a carve-out that voids the non-compete if you are terminated without cause.**

---

> ### 🚩 RED FLAG: Termination Without Cause — Employer Can End Contract in 60 Days With No Cure Period and No Severance
>
> **Section 10.2 — Termination Without Cause**
>
> The employer can terminate this contract **without cause** with only **60 days' written notice**. There is **no cure period** (no chance to fix an issue before termination), **no severance payment**, and the **non-compete and tail coverage obligations activate immediately** upon termination. Meanwhile, if *you* want to leave without cause, you must provide **90 days' notice**. This asymmetry means the employer can cut you loose in 60 days, stick you with a $30K–$80K tail bill, and bar you from practicing within 30 miles for 2 years — while you can't leave without giving 50% more notice. **Request: (1) equal notice periods of 90 days for both parties, (2) a 30-day cure period before without-cause termination, (3) 3–6 months' severance if terminated without cause, and (4) release from non-compete and tail obligations upon employer-initiated without-cause termination.**
