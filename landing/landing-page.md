# Don't Sign a Physician Contract You Don't Fully Understand.

*Your employment contract is the most consequential financial document of your career. Most physicians sign it without knowing what's buried inside.*

## The Problem

You spent 11+ years training to practice medicine. No one spent a single hour teaching you how to read an employment contract.

And these contracts are designed to protect the employer — not you.

### Here's what's at stake:

- **Tail coverage traps** — If your contract uses claims-made malpractice insurance and you leave (or get terminated), *you* may owe $50,000–$200,000+ for tail coverage. Many physicians don't discover this until it's too late.

- **Non-compete clauses** — A 25-mile, 2-year non-compete could force you to uproot your family or sit idle. Some are enforceable. Some aren't. Do you know which yours is?

- **Termination without cause** — Your employer can end the contract with 90 days' notice. Can you do the same? What happens to your patients, your tail, your bonus?

- **RVU thresholds & productivity traps** — Compensation tied to wRVUs sounds straightforward until you realize the benchmarks are unrealistic or the formula changes annually at the employer's discretion.

- **Liquidated damages** — Some contracts include penalties of $100K+ if you leave before the term expires. Even if they fire you.

- **Vague language** — "Reasonable efforts," "as determined by the Board," "consistent with community standards." These phrases give the employer unilateral control.

*The average physician contract review attorney charges $500–$1,500 and takes 2–3 weeks.* Many new attendings skip it because they're overwhelmed, pressured to sign quickly, or don't know where to start.
